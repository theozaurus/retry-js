Retry [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/theozaurus/retry-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/theozaurus/retry-js)
========

[Retry.js](http://github.com/theozaurus/retry-js) for when things don't go to
plan. This is a library that aims to make it easy to create asychronous retry
logic.

Usage
=====

In order to avoid any namespace conflicts `Retry` uses the public namespace
`com.jivatechnology` (reverse DNS scheme). You can import this into your local
scope with something like:

    var Retry = com.jivatechnology.Retry;

## Configuring

We can configure what we need from the constructor:

    var retry = new Retry({
      timeout:   3000,                     // specified in ms, how long to wait for a success
      interval:  1000,                     // How long to wait between failures before retrying initially
      max_tries: 4,                        // How many times to attempt retrying before failing
      fallback:  Retry.Fallbacks.Constant, // The scheme to use for calculating the wait between retries

      func:      function(){},             // The function to retry

      onSuccess: function(){ console.info("Yay") },
      onFailure: function(){ console.warn("Nay") },
    })


It's possible to customise it once the object has been instantiated:

    var retry = new Retry({timeout: 400});
    retry.timeout();
    => 400
    retry.timeout(500);
    => 500

## Executing

To start attempting the function we need to execute `run`:

    retry.run();

The function to retry will be checked to make sure it doesn't

 - Timeout
 - Throw an error
 - Fail (it must call `retry.failure()` if it does)

If the function has succeeded it must call `retry.success()`.

For example:

    var retry = new Retry();
    retry.func( function(){
      if(Math.random() > 0.5){
        retry.success();
      } else {
        retry.failure();
      }
    });
    retry.onSuccess.add(function(){
      console.info("Done!");
    });

    retry.run() // Start attempting to run func

This is useful for situations where you have non blocking code that uses
callback when a result is returned (e.g. a jQuery AJAX request).

## Callbacks

We can add as many callbacks as we need for success or failure as well (see [callback-js](http://github.com/theozaurus/callback-js)):

    retry.onSuccess.add(function(){ console.info("Me too")});
    retry.onSuccess.add(function(){ console.info("and me!")});

## Fallback

The fallback specifies how the interval changes over time. Often it's useful to
get behaviour whereby we intially retry quickly, then ease off. We can use the
fallback function to describe this logic.

For example if we wanted a fallback mechanism that increases the
wait by `interval` for each attempt we could write:

    var retry = new Retry();
    retry.fallback(function(){
      return this.attempt() * this.interval();
    });

There are also some standard fallback functions to get started with.

    - `Retry.Fallbacks.Constant`, will always return the same interval.
    - `Retry.Fallbacks.Fibonacci`, will increase the interval in a similar way to a fibonacci sequence

## Stopping

Once you have finished using the retry object you can `stop` it. This will
prevent any callbacks being called, ignore any requests to `failure` or
`success`. You can then reenable it by calling `run`.

    var retry = new Retry();
    retry.func(function(){ ... })
    retry.run();

    ... Do work ...

    retry.stop();


Tests
=====

All of the tests are written in [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).
[Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) is used to describe
dependencies between the files. To run the tests, you will first need to
install [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
Once you have this:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake jasmine

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

If you want to run the tests directly in the console just type:

    $ bundle exec rake jasmine:ci
    /Users/theo/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby -S rspec spec/javascripts/support/jasmine_runner.rb --colour --format progress

Or you can check the current status of master using [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/#!/theozaurus/retry-js)

Building
========

Provided you have all of the software installed to run the tests (see above).
You can build the code using:

    $ bundle exec rake build

This will create a copy of the code in the `build` folder. It will also package
up any external dependencies (such as [callback-js](http://github.com/theozaurus/callback-js)).
If you are already using `Sprockets` then it is best to copy the `src` folder
to your project and let that deal with the build dependencies (avoids
duplication).

Future
======

- Flap detection
- More fallback functions
